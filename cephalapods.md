# Cephalapods

Cephalapod is the term for a class of animals within the Mollusca phylum. Common examples of cephalapods include octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and nautilus. 

**This page will explore cephalapod camoflage techniques and different species of cephalapods.**

* Cephalapods are soft-bodied animals, so many of them use camoflage techniques to protect themselves from predators.

* They are able to change colors and create patterns due to *chromatopheres*, specialized cells in their skin filled with colored pigments.

* By detecting the color and intensity of light in their surroundings, they are able to use that sensory information to match the apperance of their environment.

* In addition to changing color, some cephalapods can also change the texture of their skin!

## Cephalapod Species  

**While there are hundreds of cephalapods, here are some of my favorites.**

| Species | Fun Fact |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Flapjack Octopus | The flapjack octopus  is a type of dumbo octopus. Dumbo octopus get their name from their fins, which resemble Disney's Dumbo the elephant's ears. They live in near the seafloor at depths up to 7,710 feet. [Watch them swim!](https://youtu.be/5ihBYwxEZLk?si=khu9xBFowt5hsCai) |

| Vampire Squid | It's scientific name means "vampire squid from hell", but the vampire squid not actually a squid - it has its own unique class (Vampyroteuthidae). These cephalapods live at depths of up to 3000 feet with no sunlight and little oxygen. They are capable of bioluminescence at will with light producing organs called *photophores*. |

| Cuttlefish | Cuttlefish are known for their amazing color-changing abilities. There are records of them changing colors while hunting to "hypnotise" their prey before striking. More social than most other cephalapods, they also use color patterns to communicate with other cuttlefish. Researchers believe how cuttlefish change their skin patterns can tell us how they perceive visual information.
