* Cephalapods are soft-bodied animals, so many of them use camoflage techniques to protect themselves from predators.

* They are able to change colors and create patterns due to *chromatopheres*, specialized cells in their skin filled with colored pigments.

* By detecting the color and intensity of light in their surroundings, they are able to use that sensory information to match the apperance of their environment.

* In addition to changing color, some cephalapods can also change the texture of their skin!

## Cephalapod Species  

**While there are hundreds of cephalapods, here are some of my favorites.**

| Flapjack Octopus | The flapjack octopus  is a type of dumbo octopus. Dumbo octopus get their name from their fins, which resemble Disney's Dumbo the elephant's ears.

| Vampire Squid | It's scientific name means "vampire squid from hell", but the vampire squid not actually a squid - it has its own unique class (Vampyroteuthidae).

| Cuttlefish | Cuttlefish are known for their amazing color-changing abilities. There are records of them changing colors while hunting to "hypnotise" their prey before striking. Researchers believe how cuttlefish change their skin patterns can tell us how they perceive visual information.
