- Sharks are a **vital** part of healthy reefs.
- They are a keystone species, meaning that their absence would have a huge impact on their environment.
- Without sharks to keep prey populations in check, there would be devasting effects on marine ecosystems. 

## Shark Behavior

> "Sharks have personality, just like you and I" - Félicie Dhellemmes

- Sharks are not the "cold-blooded killers" the media has portrayed them to be. Unconvinced? Watch this [3-minute video on the 20-year long friendship between a human diver and tiger shark](https://youtu.be/Rr_T4Aim6Fw?si=EZKWZpYdmg22CcjM). 
- There have been studies showing differences in behavior among shark species: some species are said to be "curious and confident", while other species are described as "timid and sensitive".
- Researchers have documented behavioral differences even within the same shark species, indicating sharks have unique, individual personalities and temperament!

## Shark Species

**There are countless shark species across the Earth's oceans. Here are some I find fascinating.**


| Species | Fun Fact |
