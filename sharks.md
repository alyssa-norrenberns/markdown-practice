## Shark Behavior
> Sharks have personality, just like you and I!

- sharks are not the "cold-blooded killers" the media has portrayed them to be
- there have been studies showing differences in behavior among shark species: some are said to be "curious and confident", while some are described as "timid and sensitive"
- there are behavioral differences even within the same shark species, indicating sharks have unique, individual personalities and temperment!
